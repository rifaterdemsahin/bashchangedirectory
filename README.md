### Option 1: Bash Function

You can define a Bash function directly in your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`) to handle this command pattern.

#### Steps to Create a Bash Function:

1. **Open your shell configuration file**:

   ```bash
   nano ~/.bashrc  # For bash users
   # or
   nano ~/.zshrc   # For zsh users
   ```

2. **Add the following function**:

   ```bash
   cddeployment() {
       # Check if a parameter was provided
       if [ -z "$1" ]; then
           echo "Usage: cddeployment <task_number>"
           return 1
       fi

       # Get the task number from the function parameter
       local TASK_NUMBER=$1

       # Change to the 'cddeploymenttask <task_number>' directory
       cd "cddeploymenttask $TASK_NUMBER" || { echo "Directory cddeploymenttask $TASK_NUMBER does not exist."; return 1; }

       # Change to the '2024-08-22__release_<task_number>' directory
       cd "2024-08-22__release_$TASK_NUMBER" || { echo "Directory 2024-08-22__release_$TASK_NUMBER does not exist."; return 1; }
   }
   ```

3. **Save and close the file**.

4. **Reload your shell configuration file** to apply the changes:

   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc  # For bash users
   # or
   source ~/.zshrc   # For zsh users
   ```

#### How to Use the Function

You can now use the function as a command directly in your terminal:

```bash
cddeployment 117
```

### Option 2: Bash Script

Alternatively, you can create a standalone Bash script if you prefer not to modify your shell configuration file.

#### Steps to Create the Bash Script:

1. **Create the Bash script file**:

   ```bash
   touch cddeployment
   ```

2. **Write the script to the file**:

   ```bash
   nano cddeployment
   ```

   Then add the following content:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   # Check if a parameter was provided
   if [ -z "$1" ]; then
       echo "Usage: cddeployment <task_number>"
       exit 1
   fi

   # Get the task number from the script parameter
   TASK_NUMBER=$1

   # Change to the 'cddeploymenttask <task_number>' directory
   cd "cddeploymenttask $TASK_NUMBER" || { echo "Directory cddeploymenttask $TASK_NUMBER does not exist."; exit 1; }

   # Change to the '2024-08-22__release_<task_number>' directory
   cd "2024-08-22__release_$TASK_NUMBER" || { echo "Directory 2024-08-22__release_$TASK_NUMBER does not exist."; exit 1; }
   ```

3. **Make the script executable**:

   ```bash
   chmod +x cddeployment
   ```

4. **Move the script to a directory in your PATH**, such as `/usr/local/bin`, to make it globally accessible:

   ```bash
   sudo mv cddeployment /usr/local/bin/
   ```

#### How to Use the Script

You can now use this script just like a command:

```bash
cddeployment 117
```

### Summary

- **Option 1**: A function defined in `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` allows you to use `cddeployment` directly in your terminal sessions.
- **Option 2**: A standalone script named `cddeployment` placed in a PATH directory enables the same functionality but might be easier to manage for users unfamiliar with editing shell configuration files. 

Both methods allow you to dynamically change directories based on a task number input while using `cddeployment <task_number>` as a command in your terminal.
