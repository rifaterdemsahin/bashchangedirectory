To modify the script to use `cddeploymenttask` instead of `cdissue`, you simply need to replace the occurrences of `cdissue 117` with `cddeploymenttask 117`. Here is the updated Bash script:

### Updated Bash Script

1. **Create the Bash script file** (if you haven't already):

   ```bash
   touch change_directory.sh
   ```

2. **Write the updated Bash script**:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   # Run the script in the background with &

   # Change to the 'cddeploymenttask 117' directory
   cd "cddeploymenttask 117" || exit 1  # Exit if the directory doesn't exist

   # Change to the '2024-08-22__release_117' directory
   cd 2024-08-22__release_117 || exit 1  # Exit if the directory doesn't exist

   # Create an .md file in the directory
   echo "# Directory Information" > directory_info.md
   echo "Current Directory: $(pwd)" >> directory_info.md
   echo "Content List:" >> directory_info.md
   ls >> directory_info.md

   # End of script
   ```

### Explanation of Changes

- **Directory Change**: The script now attempts to change to the directory `cddeploymenttask 117` instead of `cdissue 117`.

### Running the Script

To run this updated script in the background:

1. **Make the script executable** (if not done yet):

   ```bash
   chmod +x change_directory.sh
   ```

2. **Run the script in the background**:

   ```bash
   ./change_directory.sh &
   ```

### Notes

- The script will navigate to the `cddeploymenttask 117` directory and then to `2024-08-22__release_117`.
- The `directory_info.md` file will be created in the `2024-08-22__release_117` directory, containing the current directory path and its contents.
- Ensure that the directory `cddeploymenttask 117` exists in your current working directory and contains the subdirectory `2024-08-22__release_117`.
